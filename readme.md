AI-Powered Video Interview Bot
This is a complete, browser-based AI bot that conducts screening interviews. It uses FastAPI for the backend, LangChain with Google Gemini for AI-powered text and evaluation, and plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript for a clean user interface.

Features
Dynamic Introduction: Greets candidates with a role-specific introduction generated by AI.

AI-Generated Questions: Creates 5-7 relevant interview questions based on the job description.

In-Browser Video Recording: Uses the browser's MediaRecorder API to capture candidate responses.

AI Video Transcription: Leverages Gemini 1.5 Flash's multimodal capabilities to transcribe video responses directly.

AI Performance Summary: Provides a structured evaluation of the candidate's performance, including strengths and areas for improvement.

Tech Stack
Backend: FastAPI

AI Framework: LangChain

LLM: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Python Libraries: uvicorn, python-multipart, google-generativeai, langchain-google-genai

Prompt Design Approach
The application's AI capabilities are driven by a series of carefully crafted prompts sent to the Google Gemini models. Each prompt is designed for a specific task to ensure accurate and relevant outputs:

Introduction Prompt: This prompt instructs the AI to act as a friendly and professional hiring assistant. It uses the role_title and role_description as variables to generate a personalized and welcoming message that sets the context for the candidate.

Question Generation Prompt: This prompt is highly specific, instructing the model to generate exactly five questions covering both technical and behavioral aspects. It explicitly asks for a numbered list format to make the output easy to parse and use directly in the application.

Transcription Prompt: This is a multimodal prompt that combines a simple instruction ("Please transcribe the spoken words from this video") with the video file itself. The instruction is direct and clear to ensure the model focuses solely on transcription without adding extra commentary.

Evaluation Prompt: This prompt assigns the AI the persona of an "expert technical recruiter" to guide the tone and quality of the analysis. It provides a strict output structure (Overall Summary, Strengths, Areas for Improvement) to ensure the final report is consistent, professional, and easy for a human recruiter to read.

Setup and Installation
Step 1: Create the Folder Structure

Create the folders and empty files exactly as shown in the structure diagram above. This is a critical step.

Step 2: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the root of your project folder (ai-interview-bot) in your terminal and run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Set Your Google API Key

You need an API key from Google AI Studio. Set it as an environment variable in your terminal.

For Linux/macOS:

export GOOGLE_API_KEY='your-google-api-key'

For Windows (Command Prompt):

set GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key"

Important: You must set this key every time you open a new terminal, or add it to your shell's startup file (e.g., .bashrc, .zshrc).

Step 4: Run the Application

From the root of your project folder, run the following command:

uvicorn main:app --reload

Step 5: Use the Application

Candidate View: Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Recruiter View: After a candidate completes an interview, you can view the report at http://127.0.0.1:8000/recruiter_report.
